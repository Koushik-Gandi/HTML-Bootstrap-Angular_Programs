        <pre>
                    Capgemini was founded by Serge Kampf in 1967 as an enterprise 
                management and data processing company. The company was inaugurated 
                as the Société pour la Gestion de l'Entreprise et le Traitement de l'Information (Sogeti).

                In 1974 Sogeti acquired Gemini Computers Systems, a US company based 
                in New York. In 1975, having made two majoracquisitions of CAP and 
                Gemini Computer Systems, and following resolution of a dispute with 
                the similarly-named CAPUK over the international use of the name 'CAP',
                Sogeti renamed itself as CAP Gemini Sogeti.
                
                Cap Gemini Sogeti launched US operations in 1981, following the 
                acquisition of Milwaukee-based DASD Corporation,specializing in data 
                conversion and employing 500 people in 20 branches throughout the US. 
                Following this acquisition,The U.S. Operation was known as Cap Gemini DASD.
                
                In 1986, Cap Gemini Sogeti acquired the consulting division of US-based
                CGA Computer to create Cap Gemini America. In 1991, Gemini Consulting was 
                formed through the integration of two management consulting firms 
                (United Research and The MAC group). The Center for Business Innovation at 
                Cap Gemini was transformed from an institutional university model to a 
                networked research capability under the leadership of its 
                Director Christopher Meyer (author) in 1995.
                
                In 1996, the name was simplified to Cap Gemini with a new group logo. 
                All operating companies worldwide were re-branded to operate as Cap Gemini
